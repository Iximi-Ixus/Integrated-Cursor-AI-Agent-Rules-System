## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Python 3.7+
- No additional dependencies required (uses only standard library)

## Usage Tips

### For New Installations
```bash
# After copying .mdc files to .cursor/rules/
python scripts/validate_setup.py

# If you see warnings about placeholders:
# 1. Use design doc integration (see README.md)
# 2. Or manually replace placeholders in key files
```

### For Existing Installations
```bash
# Regular health check
python scripts/validate_setup.py --detailed

# Check after making customizations
python scripts/validate_setup.py
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### "Rules directory not found"
```bash
mkdir -p .cursor/rules
cp *.mdc .cursor/rules/
```

#### "Missing files"
```bash
# Download missing files from the repository
# Copy them to .cursor/rules/
```

#### "Contains unreplaced placeholders"
```bash
# Option 1: Use design doc integration (recommended)
# Open Cursor Chat and use the customization prompt from README.md

# Option 2: Manual replacement
# Edit files in .cursor/rules/ and replace [PROJECT_NAME] etc.
```

#### "Cross-reference errors"
```bash
# Usually means missing .mdc files
# Ensure all 13 files are present in .cursor/rules/
```

## Script Development Guidelines

### Python Scripts
- Use Python 3.7+ compatible code
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Provide colored output for better UX
- Support command-line arguments for flexibility
- Include detailed help text and examples

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Use `pathlib.Path` for file operations
- Handle different line endings appropriately
- Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Avoid shell-specific commands in Python scripts
