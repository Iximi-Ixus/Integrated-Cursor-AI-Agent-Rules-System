## Usage Tips

### Getting Started
1. **Start with similar examples**: Find the closest match to your project type
2. **Copy and adapt**: Use examples as starting points, don't start from scratch
3. **Test iteratively**: Implement one section at a time and test with your AI assistant
4. **Document changes**: Keep track of customizations that work well for your team

### Troubleshooting
- **If rules aren't loading**: Check file paths and extensions in examples above
- **If behavior is inconsistent**: Ensure placeholder replacement is complete
- **If quality gates aren't triggering**: Verify your quality commands are properly configured

### Advanced Usage
- **Multi-project setups**: Create project-specific rule variations
- **Team standards**: Share successful customizations with your team
- **Continuous improvement**: Update rules based on development patterns and lessons learned
