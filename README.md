### Fresh Project vs Established Project Setup

#### 🆕 Fresh/New Projects

**Advantages:**
- **Clean slate**: No existing patterns to conflict with rule standards
- **Immediate adoption**: Team starts with consistent AI behavior from day one
- **Proactive quality**: Rules prevent bad patterns rather than fixing them
- **Faster onboarding**: New team members get instant context through AI

**Recommended Approach:**
```bash
# 1. Set up rules before writing significant code
# 2. Use design doc integration to generate project-specific rules
# 3. Establish coding standards early through rule templates
# 4. Configure quality gates before first commits
```

#### 🏗️ Established/Legacy Projects

**Phased Implementation:**

**Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)**
```yaml
Files: 010-cursor_general_rules.mdc, 011-cursor_project_rules.mdc
Focus: Basic coordination and current tech stack documentation
Goal: AI understands existing project structure and standards
```

**Phase 2: Development Workflow (Week 3-4)**  
```yaml
Files: 030-cursor_task_rules.mdc, 032-cursor_quality_rules.mdc
Focus: Task management and quality checks for new code
Goal: Consistent approach to new feature development
```

**Phase 3: Full Integration (Month 2)**
```yaml
Files: All remaining .mdc files
Focus: Memory management, Git workflows, organization
Goal: Complete AI coordination across all development activities
```

### Cleaning Up Template Instructions

After customizing your `.mdc` files, clean up template sections to reduce token usage:

**Remove after customization:**
```bash
## CUSTOMIZATION GUIDE sections
## TECHNOLOGY TEMPLATES sections
## EXAMPLE CONFIGURATIONS sections  
## PLACEHOLDER REFERENCE sections
[PLACEHOLDER_NAME] markers that you've replaced
```

**Keep these essential elements:**
```bash
- Your actual project-specific values
- Cross-rule references (@rule_name)
- Auto-trigger keywords
- Core rule logic and frameworks
- Quality commands and workflows
```

### Customization Examples

#### Python FastAPI Project
```yaml
PROJECT_NAME: "APIService"
PROJECT_COMMAND_QUALITY: "pytest && flake8 && mypy"
MAIN_LANGUAGE: "Python"
TECH_STACK: "FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis"

### 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

#### **Rules not loading?**
```bash
# Check these common issues:
1. Ensure files are in `.cursor/rules/` directory
2. Verify files have `.mdc` extension (not .md)
3. Restart Cursor IDE after adding files
4. Check Cursor Settings > Rules to see if they're detected
```

#### **AI not following rules?**
```bash
# Try these approaches:
1. Reference rules explicitly: "Following our project rules, help me..."
2. Use auto-trigger keywords from rule files (see individual .mdc files)
3. Check that placeholders are replaced with your project specifics
4. Mention specific rules: "@010-cursor_general_rules help me with..."
```

#### **Rules seem to conflict?**
```bash
# Rule hierarchy (higher overrides lower):
1. Task-specific user instructions (highest priority)
2. Individual rule files (011-cursor_project_rules, etc.)
3. General coordination (010-cursor_general_rules)
4. Default Cursor behavior (lowest priority)
```

#### **Want to customize further?**
```bash
# Customization options:
1. Use the design doc integration approach (see Quick Start Method 2)
2. Try the '/Generate Cursor Rules' command in Cursor Chat
3. Reference specific rule files: "@011-cursor_project_rules modify..."
4. Update individual .mdc files manually with your preferences
```

#### **Performance issues or token limits?**
```bash
# Optimization strategies:
1. Remove template sections** after customization to reduce token usage
2. Use specific rule references** (`@rule_name`) instead of loading all rules
3. Consolidate duplicate information across rule files
4. Archive completed tasks** regularly to @090-completed_tasks
```

#### **System not working as expected?**
```bash
# Diagnostic steps:
1. Check .cursor/rules/ directory exists and contains .mdc files
2. Verify Cursor IDE version supports rules (newer versions recommended)
3. Test with simple request: "Show me our current task priorities"
4. Check for conflicting .cursorrules files (rename if present)
5. Review Cursor Settings > Rules for any configuration issues
```

When customizing rule files, replace these placeholders:

| Placeholder | Example Values | Used In |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| `[PROJECT_NAME]` | "TaskManager", "E-commerce API" | All files |
| `[PROJECT_COMMAND_QUALITY]` | `npm test && npm run lint`, `pytest && flake8` | Quality commands |
| `[MAIN_LANGUAGE]` | "Python", "TypeScript", "Go" | Technology specification |
| `[TECH_STACK]` | "React, Node.js, PostgreSQL" | Architecture description |
| `[FRAMEWORK]` | "Django", "Express", "React" | Primary framework |
| `[MIN_VERSION]` | "Python 3.9+", "Node 18+" | Version requirements |
| `[PACKAGE_MANAGER]` | "pip", "npm", "cargo" | Dependency management |

### Quality Commands Reference

Configure quality commands for your technology stack:

#### **Python Projects**
```bash
[PROJECT_COMMAND_QUALITY] → "pytest && black --check . && mypy ."
```

#### **JavaScript/Node Projects**
```bash
[PROJECT_COMMAND_QUALITY] → "npm test && npm run lint"
```

#### **TypeScript Projects**
```bash
[PROJECT_COMMAND_QUALITY] → "npm test && npm run lint && tsc --noEmit"
```

#### **Go Projects**
```bash
[PROJECT_COMMAND_QUALITY] → "go test ./... && go vet ./..."
```

#### **Rust Projects**
```bash
[PROJECT_COMMAND_QUALITY] → "cargo test && cargo clippy"
```

### Validation and Troubleshooting Reference

#### **Setup Validation**
```bash
# Use included validation script
python scripts/validate_setup.py --detailed

# Manual checks
ls .cursor/rules/  # Should show 13 .mdc files
grep -r "\[PROJECT_NAME\]" .cursor/rules/  # Should show minimal results after customization
```

#### **Common Issues and Solutions**

| Issue | Symptom | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Rules not loading | AI doesn't follow project patterns | Check file placement, restart Cursor |
| Placeholders visible | `[PROJECT_NAME]` in AI responses | Use design doc integration or manual replacement |
| Quality gates not triggering | No automatic quality checks | Verify `[PROJECT_COMMAND_QUALITY]` configuration |
| Cross-references broken | Rules mention missing files | Ensure all 13 .mdc files are present |
| Inconsistent behavior | AI behavior varies between sessions | Check for conflicting .cursorrules files |

#### **Performance Optimization**
- **Remove template sections** after customization to reduce token usage
- **Use specific rule references** (`@rule_name`) instead of loading all rules
- **Archive completed tasks** regularly to maintain focus on active work
- **Consolidate learned memories** to minimize information duplication

### Advanced Configuration Examples
